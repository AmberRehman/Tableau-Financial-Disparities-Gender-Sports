## Financial Disparities Between Genders in Sports

# Purpose of the Project:
The purpose of this project was to tell a story using visualizations in Tableau. Information was gathered from numerous sources in order to showcase the disparities in pay between male and female athletes.

# Data Gathered 
In order to highlight the differences in pay between male and female athletes, the data gathered consisted of: salary of highest paid male and female professional athletes, bonuses, number of basketball games played, win percentages, ticket prices, game attendance, and viewship. Potential improvements to lessen the pay disparities were also investigated and included within the story.
